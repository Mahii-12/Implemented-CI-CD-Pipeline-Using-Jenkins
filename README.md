# E-Commerce Platform System
> Created a robust E-Commerce app for seamless browsing, searching, and purchasing using Java. Backed by efficient caching, it ensures swift and reliable transactions. Built on SOLID principles, itâ€™s flexible, scalable,
delivering an efficient and satisfying shopping experience.

> Successfully implemented CRUD operations for scalable management, tested using Postman for reliable functionality.

# CI/CD
> I've defined variables application, mvnHome, dockerImage, and dockerImageTag to manage information about the application, Maven, and Docker images.

> Next, I've set up the Clone Repo stage to fetch the code from the specified GitHub repository and branch, ensuring the availability of the Maven tool for subsequent stages.

> Then, in the Build Project stage, I've utilized Maven to compile and package the project using the mvn clean install command.

> Moving on to the Build Docker Image with new code stage, I've instructed Docker to construct an image incorporating the latest code changes, assigning it the designated tag.

> Following that, I've implemented the Push Image to Remote Repo stage to upload the newly created Docker image to the remote repository, particularly DockerHub, indicating the image's tag.

> Subsequently, in the Remove running container with old code stage, I've handled the removal of any existing containers running the outdated version of the application, allowing for a clean deployment environment.

> Proceeding to the Deploy Docker Image with new changes stage, I've initiated a new container utilizing the recently updated Docker image, specifying the container's name and port mapping.

> Lastly, in the Remove old images stage, I've managed the deletion of obsolete Docker images from the repository to maintain a streamlined image registry, specifically targeting the image tagged as the latest version.

# Containerization
> After building your Spring Boot application and creating the Docker image using this modified Dockerfile, you can run the container with:

    docker build -t e-commerce-app
    docker run -p 8080:8080 e-commerce-app

    Steps:

> Containerize Microservices: 
* Packaged each microservice and its dependencies into Docker containers using Dockerfiles.
> Build Container Images:
* Created container images for each microservice using Docker build commands.
> Container Orchestration: 
* Deployed the containerized microservices to a Kubernetes cluster as MiniKube for orchestration.
> Service Discovery: 
* Used Kubernetes service objects to enable service discovery and load balancing between microservices.
> Scalability: 
* Scaled individual microservices up or down based on demand using Kubernetes scaling features.
> Continuous Deployment:
* Implemented a CI/CD pipeline to automate the building, testing, and deployment of containerized microservices.
